# three-letter-mnist

Handwritten Character Disentanglement Benchmark compiled from EMNIST dataset

EMNIST Letters data set modified to create 3-letter words.  List of 300 most commonly occuring 3 letter words is included in top_words.txt

"read_data" method checks if data set is available in this repository, and, if not, downloads, unzips, and prepares the data set.  It is called as the 'main' method. Â 

Specify # of samples of each word to include in the data set (per_word = 600 is default, and results in 600*100 words = 60000 samples).  'read_data' thus returns a numpy array of size (per_word*num_words, 28*84).  Reshape into a 28 x 84 image for viewing with 'show'.  

Each sample is generated by randomly choosing an image for each letter in the word.  Specify a seed to reproduce given data set.  Set save_img = True (likely with low per_word to avoid too many duplicates) to save test images to a new 'examples' folder.  


```
from emnist_words import EMNIST
emnist = EMNIST()
top_words = emnist.top_words_of_length(4, max_words=300)
letters = emnist.top_letters_by_position(top_words, n = 5)
train, test = emnist.valid_words_from_letters(letters)
x_train, y_train = emnist.get_data(train, per_word = 2, resample_letters = 'words')
